• Scan through once to get the general idea
• Look-up any unfamiliar vocabulary

• Consider the relation of the parts to the whole

• Interpret the meaning so is clear in your mind

• Prepare to explain it in your own words.



If you are working in a group or a class, you can also go on to:



• Discuss the saying within a peer-group

• Exchange ideas and interpretations

• Until a general agreement is reached.



If you are working in a class, you can also speak about the intended meaning with the help of a teacher in a general discussion.



There is nothing new in such a process. It is not only the way that poetry is taught but also the way, for example, we explicate, texts in foreign languages, both ancient and modern.



This book is intended to appeal to both native speakers of English and students of English as a foreign language alike.



The text is not a list of English sayings originating in the English language, but rather a compendium of sayings and words of wisdom, in English, from a wide spectrum of linguistic traditions and cultures.



The sayings do not fit together into a consistent and unified-whole. Indeed, they often contradict one another. This is to be expected, especially when we consider that a petty consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds and that the opposite of every truth is also 1

true. It is remarkable, however, to see on how many points great minds think alike irrespective of periods of time or places of origin.





Sayings in English



The first purpose of the quotations below is to introduce a selection of sayings, not only of English origin, but borrowed from an oral heritage that reaches all the way back to the Greeks and through a broad-spectrum of other cultures and languages as well. Such quotations are often anonymous, because, while we remember the words, we forget who said them. The reader will find they contain a lot of common sense and words of wisdom which are well-worth pondering.



The second purpose is to give English speakers practice in saying short, expressions and sentences to help improve their elocution skills, particularly: in pronunciation and use of rhythm and meter, to make their spoken words more audibly intelligible. Remember, even politicians and movie stars need coaching on how to better-use language to communicate clearly and understandably.



One of the hardest things to teach and learn is how to get the natural feeling and rhythm of a language right. One has to keep hearing and saying everyday common phrases, over and over again, until their sounds and patterns become second nature. To expose speakers to the natural sounds and rhythms, a native English speaker or coach should continue repeating the sayings aloud, over and over, so the students can keep repeating what they are hearing.



After spending sufficient time practicing and pronouncing the quotations, the participants may then go on to discuss amongst themselves, in small groups, how to interpret the sayings and what they think they mean. Finally, the members may interact to communicate with their language coach to express, in their own words, what they have come to understand through group-interaction. This is not easy, even for native speakers, but it certainly helps everyone involved, both native speakers and students of EFL alike, to improve their communication skills. Note, in the first few lines, the words have been rhythmically divided/ into word units/ as an aid/ in helping/ to get/ the phrasing right.

Proverbs and Sayings from Around the World Ever since the Romantic Period, through the 1800 and 1900’s, and even into the present day, western culture has borrowed images and ideas, sayings, and words of wisdom from diverse cultures and places, especially whatever seemed different, exotic and far away.

That is why, for example, we often find many Babylonian, Celtic, Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, South East Asian, and Arabian motifs in European romantic painting and literature. This is also why there are many translations into English of proverbs and sayings from odd origins, from Armenian, to Zulu, the more remote the better.



Also, since wisdom knows no borders, a lot of sayings have slipped into English from France, Spain, Germany, Scandinavia and even such Eastern European countries as Bulgaria and Romania. Such yearning for the Gothic and Arabesque, the bizarre and exotic, has never really ceased. It is still there lurking behind the face of today’s so-called technological advancement, seeking a relationship between man and nature, man and the universe, searching for meaning in a world that, in contradiction to science, seems confusing and absurd, harsh and indifferent, cold and lonely. Somehow Westerners have never completely given up the hope, however, that, somewhere out there in the world, there may be someone or some culture or something that can explain the meaning of existence and provide enlightenment into the nature of reality. Below is a selection of such sayings, listed by place of origin.

Keeping the balance of the mind takes constant practice.



It is easier to lose balance than maintain it.



One can gain enlightenment and lose it.



Right Mindfulness



Right mindfulness is the quality of awareness.





137

It insures complete awareness of all the activities of the body.



It insures complete awareness of all sensations and feelings as they occur.



Right mindfulness is complete awareness of all activities of the mind as they occur and complete awareness of all mental objects.



This attitude of complete awareness brings about powerful results.



It sharpens to the finest degree man’s powers of observation.



It induces the deepest calm and insures that nothing is said or done or thought … without deliberation.



So penetrating and powerful is the sense of awareness that every single, minute activity of the mind is observed and considered.



Realize total awareness of the true nature of phenomena the way they really are.



The minds of most beings flit about, here and there, and never are steady.



They who have no control over the mind cannot fix steadily on a subject of meditation.



Meditation fixes the flighty-mind through focus and concentration.



Nothing is as it seems because the mind embellishes experience.



Focus on contemplation of the body, of feeling, of the mind and of the mind objects.



After putting away worldly greed and grief, bring the roots of body, feeling, perceptions and objects of the mind out into the light and examine them closely for attachment and delusion.



Clearing up the cognitive field is the task of right mindfulness.



To produce mindfulness is not so much a matter of doing as a matter of undoing : not thinking, not judging, not associating, not planning, not imagining, and not wishing.



All desired objects of body, feeling emotional or wishful thinking are colored by the way the mind manipulates experience and expectation interferes with reality.



Mindfulness undoes the knots and tangles by simply observing and noting.



Mindfulness does nothing but note, watching each experience as it arises, stands and passes away.



Observation frees the mind from clinging, from compulsion and from unbridled-desire.





138

In the bright light of mindfulness, in the immediacy of observation, attachment evaporates and delusion vanishes, both burned away by the watchful eye of the mind.



In right mindfulness, there is a sustained contemplation of experience, in its bare immediacy, precisely and persistently.



The mind observes, free of meanderings, the clear nature of every experience by separating the original experience from its embellishments.



Examine the material side of existence through contemplation of the body.



Breathing meditation allows us to quiet and calm the mind, so it is in a stable state to contemplate.



Calming the body function, breathe in; calming the body function, breathe out.



Behold how the body arises; behold how the body passes away.



Mindfulness of breathing tranquilizes and calms the body function.



Mindfulness of breathing is preparatory to achievements of higher states, called the absorptions (Jhana states), and preparatory to the development of insight wisdom.



Insight wisdom makes the disciple realize, he is not the body, he is contemplating, and the personality which he thought was contemplating does not really exist.



Eventually, he realizes there is a mental process outside the self, which brings him closer to an understanding of non-ego.



There is no real self who is standing, sitting and lying.



An action of the body is devoid of an actual ego-entity.



Bending, stretching, eating, drinking, chewing, tasting, passing urine, and discharging excrement are impersonal bodily functions devoid of ego-entity.



Contemplation of the body from the top of the hair to the tip of the toes reveals a sack of skin stretched over a frame filled with impurities … sinews, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lymph, tears, skin oils, saliva mucus, urine and so on, which frees us of the delusion that the body is attractive.



Contemplation of the loathsomeness of the human body helps us to counter infatuation with the body and sexual desire.



Dissect the parts of the body with the mind, the way a butcher would cut away the organs and the heart, and set them apart.





139

The body is not a material entity with an existence of its own; it is a compilation of the four elements: solid, gas, heat and liquid.



Free yourself from the illusion that you will never die by imaging your own corpse thrown on a charnel ground, one, two, three days dead, swollen-up, blue black in color, full of corruption and decay.



You are not infallible; you are the opposite.



Explode false illusions which keep a tenacious hold on the mind.



Contemplate feeling as it arises and passes away and how the mind is disposed when it encounters an object of experience.



When a pleasant feeling arises, it may have its origin in greed and desire.



An unpleasant feeling may have its root in fear, hate or aversion.



Neutral or indifferent feelings may arise out of dullness of mind or delusion.



Look at experience, and cut off the root of unwholesome intent, as it begins to rise and interact with feeling.



If we just allow the mind to play, uncontrolled defilements will color experience.



Watch an experience as it arises and as it passes away; catch unwanted Karma and defuse attachment, aversion or indifference.



Through mindfulness, we can turn experience back into a bare mental event, shorn of subjective interplay.



Let the flow of events arise and dissolve without being subjective.



When the wholesome root of feeling loses its hold on events, the events lose their sense of permanence and become part of the stream of impermanent flux.



Non-involvement means detachment from a sense of permanence.



In contemplation of mind, the disciple knows that the greedy mind is being greedy; he knows that the hating-mind is hateful; that the deluded mind is deluded; the cramped mind is cramped; the scattered mind is scattered; and the undeveloped mind is undeveloped; the un-concentrated mind is un-concentrated.



In concentration of the mind, the disciple knows when the action of the mind is not greedy or hateful, not deluded or cramped and not scattered and undeveloped.



In contemplation of the mind, the disciple observes how the surpass-able mind is surpass-able, the concentrated mind is concentrated, and the freed mind is freed.



140



The disciple knows that mind means ‘consciousnesses’ rather than thinking as an enduring separable entity.



The mind is a sequence of momentary mental acts unconnected to a sense of self or belonging to self.



Mind is a bare state of consciousness free of subjective association.



As meditation practice deepens, the observer becomes more and more detached until there is only detached-mind.



As meditation practice deepens, the unwholesome roots of greed, aversion, and delusion become less-capable of interacting in consciousness.



As meditation practice deepens, the mind becomes less-cramped and scattered, and more-developed and concentrated, more-and-more free, and more-and-more pure.



As contemplation deepens, the contents of the mind become more and more purified and rarified.



Irrelevant flights of fancy, imagination and emotion gradually subside, and the mind becomes clearer, and more intently aware, watching its own process of becoming.

The seeming, solid, stable mind dissolves into a consciousness of a series or sequence of perceptions in the mind (Cittas) flashing in and out of being, moment by moment, coming from nowhere and going nowhere, yet continuing in sequence without pause.



Contemplation of the mind objects focuses on the five hindrances of lust, anger, torpor or sloth, mental worry and restlessness and, finally, doubt.



Mind objects mean the bare facts of events colored by lust, anger, sloth, restlessness and doubt.



The disciple dwells in contemplation of the mind objects, the five hindrances.



He knows when there is lust in him; he knows when there is anger, knows when there is torpor or sloth, knows when there is restlessness and mental worry, and knows when there are doubts.



He knows when the mind is free of the five hindrances : he knows when the mind is free of lust, anger, sloth, worry and doubt.



He knows how they arise, and he knows how they are overcome.



He knows how they do not rise again in the future.





141

The five hindrances may be overcome through the antidote of the seven factors of enlightenment: mindfulness, investigation, energy, rapture, tranquility, concentration and equanimity.



Through mindfulness, we block unwholesome arisen states through concentration and bring the mind to one-pointed-ness and balance.



Right mindfulness means maintaining clarity and balance so the mind can concentrate purely on the path.



The disciple is mindful of how unwholesome states arise and pass away, of how consciousness arises and passes away, how investigation arises and passes away, how energy, rapture and restlessness come into play and pass away, how tranquility and concentration come into play and pass away, how one can continue on the path, and how one can be hindered.



The disciple contemplates how the mind objects arise and pass away and lives in independence, unattached to this world, entering the path and realization of Nirvana.



The Buddha only points out the steps in the path; no one can take these steps for you.



It behooves the disciple to have a good teacher, to guide him on the path, to keep him from going astray through ignorance and delusion.



This is why disciples take refuge in the Buddha, the Monk-hood (Sangha), and the Dharma : the Holy Triple Gem.



Joining the monk-hood is not the only way. Instances have been recorded of laymen achieving Nirvana.



Right Concentration



Right concentration ensures one-pointed-ness of mind.



It is the ability to focus one’s mind, steadily, on any one object only, to the exclusion of others.



Long-continued practice of mental concentration makes the mind highly penetrative.



It becomes like a high-powered light which can illuminate any object on which it is focused.



Now, this concentration of the mind, like virtue, is not an end in itself.



The purpose of developing this is concentration (Samadhi) to make use of its penetrative power, to understand existence and, thereby, realize the highest wisdom.





142

We come now to wisdom, in which state this highly concentrated mind, abiding in calm concentration (Samadhi) is made to focus its attention on the three great characteristics of existence, namely impermanence, suffering and egoless-ness, the mind is able to see things as they are.



The result is the dawning of the highest understanding, which is the first factor of the eightfold path, through which, when perfected, one is able to see reality.



This realization coincides with the cessation of craving and the attainment of Nirvana.



What now is right concentration? Having the mind fixed to a single object. This is concentration.



There are different levels of one-pointed-ness.



Just being able to concentrate on one object to the exclusion of all others is not enough.



One-pointed-ness alone is not enough and is not an end in itself.



Right concentration must be directed to higher purposes and right understanding, so the disciple should avoid concentration on the body or other unwholesome states.



One has to transcend the level of worldly states and concentrate on an object in a manner that causes holy states to arise.



Right concentration reflects the culmination of all the achievements of the factors of the eightfold path working simultaneously to obtain the right point of one-mindedness.



This understanding leads to the achievement of new mental states beyond those already experienced.



Right concentration looks back upon right understanding, right effort, right intention and right mindfulness.



Right concentration reflects on the four foundations of mindfulness : contemplation of the body, contemplation of feeling, contemplation of mind, and contemplation of mind objects.



Right concentration requires the four great efforts : First, abandon unwholesome states before they arise by blocking the five hindrances of sensual desire, ill-will, drowsiness, restless worry and doubt.



Second, right concentration requires the disciple to abandon unwholesome arisen states through concentration on the impermanence of life, deterioration of the body, loving kindness, compassion, breathing meditation, investigative analysis, and other meditation forms suggested by the Buddha.





143

Third, right concentration requires the arising of wholesome states of the mind through the seven steps to enlightenment : mindfulness, investigation, energy, rapture, tranquility, concentration and equanimity.



Fourth, right concentration means maintaining wholesome states once they have arisen through illuminating the four noble truths : the nature of suffering, the cause of suffering, the extinction of suffering, and the Middle Way.



Right concentration, then, looks forward to a realization through right mindfulness, of the impermanence of the moment, the fleeting nature of existence, the transitory nature of being, the vanity of grasping, the illusory nature of consciousness, freedom from the delusion of self, deliverance from worldly desire, detached concentration, rapture, tranquility, and equanimity.



Accompanying detached observation, watching the play of events, after extended practice, the disciple comes to learn about two methods of concentration : In the first one, insight meditation, he does not deliberately attempt to exclude the multiplicity of phenomena from his field of attention.



Instead, he directs mindfulness to the changing states of the mind and body, noting any phenomenon that presents itself.



The task of insight meditation is to maintain a conscious awareness of whatever enters the range of perception, clinging to nothing.



Upon continuance of the noting of events of the mind, concentration becomes stronger, moment after moment, until it becomes established one-pointedly on the constant stream of events.



When insight meditation is accomplished sufficiently, it leads to a breakthrough to the final stage of the path to freedom, insight and wisdom.



The second method of concentration is called tranquility meditation, in which the disciple concentrates firmly on one object, presumably an object given him by his teacher.



In tranquility meditation, the disciple focuses his mind on the object and tries to keep it there, fixed and alert.



If the mind strays, he notices this, and quickly catches the mind and brings it back, firmly but gently, to the object, doing this over and over as often as necessary.



This is called the initial application of tranquility meditation.



Next, sustained concentration anchors the attention on the object and holds it there until the disciple, begins to experience rapture, delight and joy and happiness, culminating in one-pointed-ness.





144

As one continues to meditate, these factors combine, complement one another, and pick up power to steer the mind to mental states called absorptions, which are beyond the reach of the five-fold sense activity.



The mental states called absorptions can only be attained in solitude through unremitting perseverance.



In these states, all activity of the five senses is suspended.



No visual or audible impressions arise at this time.



No bodily feeling is felt, but although all other senses have ceased, the mind remains active, perfectly alert, and fully awake.



The term ‘absorption’ is sometimes improperly translated as ‘trance,’ but this rendering may be vague and misleading, and Pali scholars call the four absorptions the ‘Jhana’

states.



Detached from sensual objects, detached from evil things, the disciple enters the first absorption, which is accompanied by thought concentration and discursive thinking, which is born of detachment and filled with rapture and happiness.



The first absorption is attained when, through strength of concentration, the fivefold sense activity is temporarily suspended, and the five senses are likewise eliminated.



The first absorption is free from five things and five things are present.



When the disciple enters the first absorption, there have vanished the five hindrances of lust, ill-will, torpor and sloth, restlessness, mental worry and doubts; and there are present concentration of thought, discursive thinking, rapture, happiness and concentration.



And further, after subsiding of thought concentration and discursive thinking, and, by the gaining of inner-tranquility and oneness of mind, he enters into a state free from thought concentration and discursive thinking, the second absorption, which is born of concentration and filled with rapture and happiness.



And further, after the doing away of rapture, he dwells in equanimity, mindful, with clear awareness; and he experiences in his own person, that feeling of which the noble say,

‘happy is he who dwells in equanimity and mindfulness.’ Thus, he enters into the third absorption.



The four immaterial absorptions which are based on the fourth absorption are produced by meditating on their respective objects from which they derive their names, which are sphere of unbounded space, of unbounded consciousness, nothingness and neither perception nor non-perception.



These absorptions, reached by the path of serenity meditation, as exalted as they are, still lack the wisdom of insight and, so, are not sufficient for gaining deliverance.



145



Tranquility concentration does not guarantee freedom from unwholesome states and does not lead as a matter of course to a sort of breakthrough that can be expected in insight meditation.



The way to wisdom is fulfillment of the eightfold path through understanding and right intention, making a final effort to overcome the root of suffering.



The way to wisdom, the goal of the mind, is to find its resolution in the opposite extreme of the body, the root of worldly Karma.



It means a final realization of the significance of the four noble truths, realizing the path to freedom from suffering, breaking the final shackles of desire; it means bringing about the extinction of suffering and letting go of the world to be free to enter Nirvana.



The root of suffering is a simple, obvious and powerful truth, but the understanding the root is one thing and eradicating it is quite another.



The problem is that the source of the affliction is latent and dormant, and we can’t get at it, if we don’t know about it.



Evenly highly-developed and very advanced disciples can have hidden remnants of desire below the level of awareness which hold them back from making the final step to freedom.



Ignorance of deep-seated powers that dominate volition can hold back even the most strong and gifted.



Ignorance distorts perception and causes delusion; thus the disciple, in spite of his good intentions, seeks permanence in the impermanent, self in the selfless and gets a distorted view of reality which hinders his progress on the path to reality.



In spite of knowing better, he unconsciously perceives himself as a self-contained ego which has the innate right to pleasure.



Wisdom is the antidote to ignorance and delusion because the most pernicious of cognitive distortions is a sense of permanent self that craves permanent pleasures in a permanent world.



The solution is to focus on the burning light of concentration on illuminating the desultory nature of cognitive perception.



Trapped in a dichotomy where the mind has the volition to go in one direction, but the innate tendency to take the path of least resistance, force it, through intense effort, to go the other way : to go against the stream.



Wisdom centers on development insight : a deep and comprehensive seeing into the nature of existence.



146



This necessitated discursive thought and analysis of the true nature of being, getting at the true nature of existence before it is defiled by unconscious intentions through the power of the light of the mind to reduce an experience to the bare fact, without subjective involvement.



Eventually, if the disciple pushes investigation to its end, he will discover that there is no reality, no independent self observing. There is only the bare fact of arising.



Similarly, he will discover there are no permanent facts of existence to grasp onto for pleasure or for any other reason.



The antidote to the dissatisfaction connected to the idea of permanence, pleasure and self is through insight meditation to observe or concentrate upon impermanence, unsatisfactory-ness and selflessness.



The objects of perception are mere strings of momentary sensations, bubbles, about ready pop, that can’t be grasped.



The stream of mental events is made up of images that are constantly breaking up.



Unsatisfactory-ness means that nothing lasts; there is nothing to hang onto that will give you lasting pleasure.



Selflessness means that if we are not the owners of the perceptions which we try to grasp and hold, the very idea of self is just such a transitory perception.



When the course of insight practice is entered, the eight path factors become charged with a previously unknown intensity.



They gain force and fuse together into the unity of a single cohesive path heading towards the goal.



The factors of the concentration group keep the mind firmly-fixed upon the stream of phenomena.



As the wisdom of insight deepens, right understanding deepens and right intentions intensify in an effort to penetrate the world of arising events.



This stage is called the mundane path.



The mundane path contemplates the events of a conditional world.



When insight meditation pushes beyond the mundane world, it enters the supra-mundane paths, which mean contemplation and realization of unconditional levels.



The supra-mundane truths of impermanence, unsatisfactory-ness and selflessness are the antidote to the inherent defilements of the mundane path.



147



The mind breaks through worldly delusions and realizes that the opposite of the natural inclinations of the mind represent the truths of nature.



The supra-mundane path frees the mind from the root of delusion about permanence and self and brings the mind to the point where it is finally ready to comprehend the four noble truths, the starting point and the culmination of the Buddha’s teaching.



The mind sees the nature of suffering, the cause of suffering and, then, the way to the extinction of suffering, through the middle way and the noble eightfold path.



When all the factors of the path are functioning without hindrance, the mind works with powerful intensity, through right understanding and right intention to focus on the attainment of Nirvana.



When the supra-mundane paths are entered, the extinction of the latent tendencies to defilements is explicit.



Theravada teaching classifies such fetters as follows : personality view, doubt, clinging to rites and rituals, sensual desire, aversion, desire for fine material existence, conceit, restlessness and ignorance.



The four supra-mundane paths eliminate certain layers of defilement.



The first supra-mundane path which is called stream entry strikes at the roots of the first three fetters.



First, personality view is cut off when one begins to see that a permanent self is illusory.



Second, doubt is eliminated when, through a sense of accomplishment, one gains firm confidence in pursuit of the path.



Third, clinging to rules and rites is abandoned, when one realizes that the truth is not imposed through outside conventions, but must come from within.



The second stage, which is called the path of the once-returner, does not eradicate the defilements entirely but greatly reduces the roots.



In this stage, the practitioner reaps the fruit of stream entry, enjoying a sense of peaceful bliss which accompanies momentary release from the first three fetters, giving a glimpse or insight into Nirvana before the mind sinks back into defilement.



The disciple who has experienced this first fruit can never turn back.



He may have to be reborn to do it, but he will eventually overcome these impurities.



He has acquired the essential realization needed to achieve Nirvana, and there will be no turning him back from that ultimate goal.



148



The third stage is the path of the non-returner, in which the disciple cuts off the roots of the fourth and fifth fetters of sensual desire and ill-will.



Never again will he feel the need to be reborn in a human state of existence; instead, he will be reborn in a higher state in a ‘fine material world’ and there attain deliverance.



The fourth state is the path of Enlightenment (Arahantship) in which the aspirant cuts off the five remaining fetters :



Which are desire for a fine material existence, immaterial existence, and the bonds of conceit, restlessness and ignorance.



He has practiced the eightfold path and followed it to full fruition.



Endowed with its eight factors, in full perfection, he lives in the enjoyment of their fruits, enlightenment and final deliverance.



He is free from all bondage in the round of all rounds of existence (Samsara.).



Fulfillment of the path is transcending and going beyond the need for it.



The understanding of the relaxation of endeavor is knowledge of fruition.



The path performs the task of breaking up defilements which leads, when this demanding exertion subsides, to the bliss of Nirvana.



The higher reaches of the path might seem remote from our present standing and the demands of the practice hard to fulfill, but the only requirements for reaching the goal are two : to start and to continue.



Talking about the final stages of the path is as difficult as navigating uncharted waters.



Talking about the higher states is unsuitable material for teaching, as they must be experienced rather than thought about or discussed, and therein the lies the answer.



The aspirant must practice the factors of the path, step-by-step, stage-by-stage, through gradual practice, through gradual progress, until he begins to reap the fruit of his efforts.



Experience of the higher states will come, even if progress seems slow and the need for effort seems relentless.



Progress in the path is like rubbing two sticks together to make fire.



If you stop for a rest, you’ll lose most of the progress you’ve made and have to start-over, but if you continue, in an unrelenting manner, you will eventually succeed.



Start and continue and you will see where the effort leads.

The eightfold path starts with right understanding of suffering and the origins and cessation of suffering and the middle way leading to the cessation of suffering.



It continues through right intentions of renunciation of unwholesome intentions and wholesome intentions of good will and harmlessness, abstaining from false, slanderous, harsh, idle speech, abstaining from taking life, stealing, sexual misconduct, and abstaining from earning one’s livelihood by unwholesome means.



It continues through right action, into right effort and abandoning the defilements developing and maintaining wholesome states, with the help of right mindfulness, contemplation of the body, the feelings, the mind, and the objects of perception of the mind, so the aspirant achieves right concentration, passing through the stages of Jhana and the four supra-mundane states directed towards the final deliverance from the rounds of existence (Samsara) and release into a state of Nirvana.



It is difficult to conceive of something more difficult than continued and unrelenting adherence to the path.



Just rubbing two sticks together to make a fire is mere child’s play by comparison.



A more appropriate analogy would be to say that following the path is like trying to put out a fire that has spread everywhere and seems to be out of control.



It is harder to put out such a fire than it is to start one, yet that is what Buddhist practice concentrates upon, blowing out the fire of desire, little-by-little, bit-by-bit, until the last flicker disappears bringing release and the achievement of Nirvana.



Start and continue, and you will see where the effort leads.



Practice of the eightfold path is strict and rigorous, grasping the discipline of the path, and going at it with unrelenting vigor, hanging on hard, with a determination that is extreme; on the other hand, however, it is good to be reminded that the perception of the opposite of every extreme helps to bring perspective into balance.



One cannot achieve Nirvana while in a state of stress.



Thus the aspirant will realize that, having followed the rigors of the path of fruition, he must finally let go.



It’s a paradox, but in the resolution of that paradox is the answer.



The aspirant will only be able to achieve Nirvana when he learns to let go.
